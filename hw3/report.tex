\section{Introduction}
This assignment consisted on the implementation of several \emph{regression} methods to try to predict the rate of violent crimes per population of several cities of the United States. \\

For that purpose, a dataset from the \emph{UC Irvine} machine learning repository was provided. The programming language used have been \texttt{R}, and this report have been typeset using \LaTeX.

\subsection{Conclusions}
\subsubsection{Standard data}
The Mean-squared error on both the full regression 
and the tested regression are both quite small. 
The tested regression Mean-squared error is a little larger as it has less data

The residual graph was relatively poorly behaved with some strange linear structures.
The lack a ``banna'' shows that our problem is not likely to be fixed by Boxcox or other types of transformed. We need more explanatory values.
According to the Residuals VS Leverage graph no points had undue influence
or worry some cooks distance.

This show that the regression is likely possible with our data but needs work.


\subsubsection{Box-Cox transformed data}
Our Boxcox transformed data looked promising but has a larger Mean-squared error.
The residual graph shows that while the data looks straighter the linear structures can still be seen.
However the when one accounts for the change in base in the distortion graph looks far worse. We also see that at low fitted values the data looks split and some have extremely low Residuals. This is likely caused by values extremely close to zero.

Boxcox was useless. 

\section{Basics - Nearest Neighbor regression}
\subsection{Implementation}
\lstinputlisting[firstline=84, lastline=112]{crimes.R}

\subsection{Results}

- Mean-squared error on the test data (20\%): 3.64e-02

\subsection{Conclusions}
The Mean-squared error on k-nearest neighbor regression did not work as well as the
 linear regression. It's  Mean-squared error was signifantly higher and looks worse.
 Scaling the data changed nothing. I am guessing that the data set was prescaled.

\section{Dealing with missing values}
\subsection{Implementation}

\lstinputlisting[firstline=114, lastline=163]{crimes.R}


\subsection{Results}
Linear Regression (imputed missing values):
 - Mean-squared error on the test data (20\%): 1.88e-02
Nearest Neighbours (imputed missing values):
 - Mean-squared error on the test data (20\%): 1.00e-01

\subsection{Conclusions}
The Mean-squared error of the test sets did not change much for liner regression 
on this new data. The Mean-square error was far worse for the nearest neighbors.

If Residuals graph looks like it has a slightly better shape but larger residuals.
if you look at the leverage graph it is clear that a few points have higher 
leverage and one point even has a cooks distance of one.

It seams that implementation of missing values lets us have more 
explanatory variables but add more noise. For linear regression it's 
a wash but for nearest neighbors the noise is too much.

The additional explanatory variables is not enough to fix our regression
and are likely not woth the truble.



\section{Modified Nearest Neighbours}
\subsection{Implementation}
\lstinputlisting{nn-modified.R}

\vspace{-0.4cm}
\subsection{Conclusions}
Two different implementations have been tried for this exercise, one that computes the distance between two vectors with some question mark elements in a linear way (\texttt{distance\_lin}) and other that does the same but with vectorial operations (\texttt{distance\_vec}). \\

Unfortunately, the linear code that uses this distance functions and other \texttt{R} specific instructions to apply the function to matrix columns, like \texttt{outer}, were so slow during the execution that it was impossible to obtain results.
